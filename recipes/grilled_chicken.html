    <h1>Grilled Greek Chicken Breasts with Whipped Feta</h1>

    <p>Just because I almost never grill boneless, skinless chicken breasts doesn't mean I shouldn't still want to teach those who do the best way to do it, which is why I'm posting this video for grilled Greek chicken breasts with whipped feta. That's the official reason. The real, actual reason is that I was looking for an excuse to consume large quantities of whipped feta, also known as my new favorite thing to eat.</p>

    <p>In fact, even if you never make the chicken part of this recipe, which you should, since it's really, really good, but even if you don't, please promise me you'll make a nice big batch of whipped feta to serve on, or with… everything. And I mean that literally. This simple spread/dip/condiment would be fantastic with anything off of the grill this summer, since cool and tangy always pairs perfectly with hot and smoky.</p>

    <p>As far as the Greek-style marinade goes, I think this is the perfect formula for the almost always boring boneless, skinless breasts. We're basically soaking the chicken in a salad dressing, and unless you horribly overcook the meat, the results are going to be consistently excellent. When it comes to grilling chicken, I'm a thigh guy, but I'd eat this any time, anywhere. By the way, this marinade will work with any chicken parts you want. But no matter what you use, I really hope you give this a try soon.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Whipped Feta:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>cup full-fat Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>8 ounces feta cheese</li>
        <li>teaspoon finely crushed garlic, or to taste</li>
        <li>tablespoon chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5><strong>Step 1</strong></h5>
            <p>Cut chicken breasts in half lengthwise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5><strong>Step 2</strong></h5>
            <p>Combine red wine vinegar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, thyme, oregano, rosemary, and garlic powder in a bowl. Add chicken and toss until thoroughly and evenly coated. Pour in ¼ cup olive oil and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 12 hours, but 2 to 3 hours is ideal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5><strong>Step 3</strong></h5>
            <p>Place Greek yogurt in another bowl and crumble in feta cheese. Add garlic, mint, and lemon zest and whip with an electric hand mixer or whisk until light and fluffy. Taste and adjust as needed. Refrigerate until needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5><strong>Step 4</strong></h5>
            <p>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are white and very hot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5><strong>Step 5</strong></h5>
            <p>Grill chicken over the hot coals for about 4 minutes per side; continue to flip and grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each piece reads at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from the grill and let rest for about 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5><strong>Step 6</strong></h5>
            <p>Spread whipped feta onto a serving platter or plate and place chicken over top. Sprinkle with fresh Italian parsley and mint and serve.</p>
        </li>
